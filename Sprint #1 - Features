Task 2

Deadline: September 22nd
Work Required: HTML prototype based on our information architecture

As a user I should have the ability to save candidates
under my account and have the my account remember saved candidates. 
Candidates can be either in office or running, 
and they should appear under a favorites/saved list where I can have quick access. 
(Maybe have a quick summary view for each candidate?)

Bookmark instead of save??? This would provide a user with a previous set of used data…

Dashboard for a user with saved data.

First time user? You have an empty dashboard which will onboard your user experience...
